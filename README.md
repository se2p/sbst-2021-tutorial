# Simulation-Based Testing of Self-Driving Car Software using BeamNG.tech

This repository contains the material for the [Tutorial](https://sbst21.github.io/keynotes/) on Simulation-Based Testing of Self-Driving Car Software using BeamNG.tech that Alessio Gambi presented at the [14th International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing](https://sbst21.github.io/) on May the 31st, 2021.

The "short" version of the tutorial video (ca 00:45:00) is available on youtube [here](https://youtu.be/_IjEaAk52-8). In this short version, Alessio Gambi presents only a subset of the slides posted in this repository.

The "extended" version of the tutorial (ca 1:45:00) covers all the material and is also available on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-CTMMNE0JU).

The aim of this tutorial is to provide everybody with the basics notion on simulation-based testing and how to implement them using the photo-realistic, accurate, physical simulator [BeamNG.tech](https://beamng.gmbh/research/), and how to generate tests automatically.

The tutorial is divided in three parts:

1. Getting a grip on the simulator
2. Simulation-based testing (all that I know of... but you may know more!)
3. Examples of automated test generation using search-based software testing

# Credits
The material presented in the slides/video comes from different sources, including BeamNG.GmbH (thanks Marc, Pascale, and Eva) and other researchers (thanks Vincenzo Riccio from Precrime @ Software Institue - Lugano). 

If I forgot someone, please give me a call and I'll add your name here :D
